The goal of FEDRamp is to unify the U.S. government under one standardized cloud based security assessment which in turn modernizes the governments IT infrastructures while protecting federal data.
A standardized security baseline being used by all federal agencies increases the speed and efficency of vendors providing cloud services due to needing to meet an authorization that can be applied to different organizations.
